            <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
            <div class="fix-list">
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">1. The problem interview protocol
Conduct 10 interviews focused exclusively on the problem space. Use these questions: "Walk me through the last time you encountered this problem." "How do you currently solve it?" "How much time/money does this cost you?"</span>
                </label>
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">2. The solution sketch method
Test solutions without the sunk cost of development: Clickable Figma mockups, Detailed product descriptions or landing pages with "fake" buttons, and Service Prototyping.</span>
                </label>
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">3. The "five why" technical justification
Before any feature is coded, you must answer: Why this feature? Why now? Why this way? Why us? Why not later?</span>

            <p>I built a sophisticated algorithm for "meaningful engagement." My first beta tester, Chloe, took one look and said: "I don't care about engagement. Does this post actually drive sales?"</p>
            <p>The next four calls were the same. I soon figured out that I had built a solution to a problem nobody had.</p>
            <p>The cost: Six months of work, thousands in server fees, and countless late nights.</p>
            <p>The reminder: If you're not talking to users, you're just writing fan fiction about your own genius.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Code is liability; user understanding is an asset. Every line of code represents complexity added and flexibility lost. The best founders don't fall in love with their solutions; they fall in love with their users' problems.</p>
            <p>Talk to your customers first. Only after then should you code. Do this every time.</p>
