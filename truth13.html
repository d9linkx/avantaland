            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>I have a graveyard of code that never saw the light of day. The most expensive tombstone belongs to a social analytics platform I spent six months building in isolation. I was proud of my sophisticated algorithm. My first beta tester took one look and said, "I don't care about engagement. Does this drive sales?" I had built a beautiful solution to a problem nobody had. Every line of un-validated code is a liability. It adds complexity and reduces flexibility. Stop writing fan fiction about your own genius. Talk to users first. Code later.</p>

    <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
    <div class="fix-list">
        <label class="fix-item">
            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>1. Ask About the Struggle:</strong> 
            Talk to 10 people about the problem you want to solve. Don't mention your idea yet. Instead, ask them: "Tell me about the last time this happened," "How are you dealing with it now?" and "How much time or money is this costing you?"</span>

            <span class="fix-text"><strong>2. Show a "Fake" Version First:</strong> 
            Test your idea without building the real thing. Show people a simple drawing, a basic webpage with a button that says "Coming Soon," or offer to do the work by hand first. If people don't click or show interest now, they won't buy the finished version either.</span>

            <span class="fix-text"><strong>3. Question Every New Feature:</strong> 
            Before you spend time adding something new, ask yourself: Why is this needed right now? Is there a simpler way to do it? Why are we the ones to do it? Can this wait until next month? If you can't give a good reason, don't do it.</span>

            <p>I have a graveyard of code that never saw the light of day. The most expensive tombstone is "Project Sisyphus", a social analytics platform I spent six months building before speaking to a single user.</p>
            <p>I built a sophisticated algorithm for "meaningful engagement." My first beta tester, Chloe, took one look and said: "I don't care about engagement. Does this post actually drive sales?"</p>
            <p>The next four calls were the same. I soon figured out that I had built a solution to a problem nobody had.</p>
            <p>The cost: Six months of work, thousands in server fees, and countless late nights.</p>
            <p>The reminder: If you're not talking to users, you're just writing fan fiction about your own genius.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Code is liability; user understanding is an asset. Every line of code represents complexity added and flexibility lost. The best founders don't fall in love with their solutions; they fall in love with their users' problems.</p>
            <p>Talk to your customers first. Only after then should you code. Do this every time.</p>
