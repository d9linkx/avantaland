"The first time I explained my startup idea to my father, he listened patiently, nodded, and asked: ""But when are you going to get a real job?"" The skepticism wasn't just coming from family.

Potential hires would choose stable jobs at known companies over our risky venture.

Investors would poke endless holes in our model.

Industry ""experts"" would explain why our approach was fundamentally flawed.

I made the mistake of taking it personally. Each comment felt like a paper cut; small but cumulative. I found myself spending more mental energy defending our right to exist than actually building the business.

The breaking point came when I almost turned down a brilliant engineer because he asked too many hard questions. My co-founder called me out: ""You're surrounding yourself with yes-people because you're tired of being questioned. But that's how companies die.""

The lesson: I was building an echo chamber to protect my ego while starving the business of critical thinking. The questions weren't the problem; my relationship with them was.

The anatomy of businessskepticism

Most people are wired for risk aversion. When they encounter something unconventional, their first instinct is protection, protecting you from failure or protecting the status quo.

Is that love? Well, you be the judge of that. Will that help you grow? I'm the judge: hell no!

You must learn to spot external doubt from those who love you, and know exactly what to do about it.

The three phases of external doubt

Phase 1: The ""it won't work"" stage: People point out flaws in the idea or the market. This is their risk-assessment instinct.

Phase 2: The ""but why you?"" stage: Once you have progress, they question your capabilities. ""Are you sure you can scale this?""

Phase 3: The ""is it worth it?"" stage: When you succeed, the questions shift to opportunity cost and burnout.

The three types of questioners

The well-meaning protectors: Family and friends who care about you but don't understand the business world. Their questions come from love.

The armchair experts: People who have never built anything but have strong opinions on your mental ""chess game.""

The mirrored insecurities: People whose own fears are triggered by your ambition. Their questions are projections of their own self-doubt.

What to do when you spot these?

Implement the ""skepticism filter""

You cannot stop the doubts and questions they raise. But you can build a filtering system that uses skepticism as fuel. How? Stop seeking validation from people who aren't qualified to give it, and do these three things instead.

1. Create your own ""Board of Directors of the mind""

Identify 3–5 people who have earned the right to question you deeply. These are people who:

Have relevant expertise.

Understand your vision.

Want you to succeed but won't spare your feelings.

Everyone else's questions are categorized as ""background noise."" When your uncle questions your life choices to start something so risky as a startup, you smile and say, ""I appreciate your concern,"" while mentally filing it under “more noise”. When your ""Board"" questions you, you lean in.

Also, don't forget to quietly “fire” them when they switch and appoint new credible ones in their stead.

How do you know when they've switched? Well, you will know. Trust your instincts.

2. Implement the ""skepticism journal""

Keep a running log of common criticisms you receive. Once a month, conduct a triage:

Category 1: Valid concerns. These point to real weaknesses (e.g., regulatory hurdles). These become action items.

Category 2: Interesting perspectives. These don't require action but might inform future strategy.

Category 3: Noise. Uninformed opinions and conventional wisdom that doesn't apply to businesses.

3. Develop the ""Why I’m Building This"" anchor document

Write a one-page document answering these in emotional terms:

What problem breaks my heart enough to spend years solving it?

Who specifically am I building this for?

What does success look like for them?

Read this every morning. 98% of that skepticism will evaporate when held against a clear, compelling documented purpose.

Summary

If you need cheerleaders, start a sports team. If you're building a startup, prepare for skeptics. Allow their questions to sharpen your thinking and purpose, not shatter your confidence.

The validation that matters doesn't come from unanimous approval; it comes from customers paying for your solution and your own growing conviction. Stop collecting people's opinions and start collecting proof."
