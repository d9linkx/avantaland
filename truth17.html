            <p>I sat in a product meeting that perfectly captured the feature obsession. Our team was debating whether to build a dark mode for our SaaS platform. The arguments were passionate: "All the best apps have it!" "It's table stakes now!"</p>

            <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
            <div class="fix-list">
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">1. Implement the "outcome hypothesis" framework
For every initiative, you must complete this sentence: "We believe that by building [capability], we will see [measurable change in behavior], which will drive [business metric]."</span>
                </label>
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">2. Create a "metric-based backlog"
Replace your feature wish list with a prioritized list of business metrics you want to move: Improve free-to-paid conversion, Reduce first-week churn, Increase weekly sessions per user.</span>
                </label>
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">3. Run "outcome sprints"
Restructure your development cycles around results rather than just shipping code. A sprint goal should be a metric, not a feature list. At the end of the sprint, you don't demo features; you present data.</span>

            <p>I sat in a product meeting that perfectly captured the feature obsession. Our team was debating whether to build a dark mode for our SaaS platform. The arguments were passionate: "All the best apps have it!" "It's table stakes now!"</p>
            <p>We were about to greenlight two weeks of development time when our newest engineer, Maya, asked a simple question: "What user outcome does dark mode actually drive?"</p>
            <p>The room went silent. We had feature arguments, but no outcome arguments. We spent the next hour digging into the data and realized something: The users "begging" for dark mode represented 0.3% of our user base. Our key metrics—retention, time in app, conversion—would be completely unaffected.</p>
            <p>We were about to burn precious engineering cycles on a feature that would make no measurable difference to our business. I've watched businesses die this way.</p>
            <p>One team built 27 different integrations but couldn't get users to complete basic onboarding. Another had a "comprehensive" analytics dashboard that 2% of users ever looked at, while cancellations climbed.</p>
            <p>The most successful product decision I ever made was saying "no" to 90% of feature requests. We maintained a brutally simple product that did one thing exceptionally well.</p>
            <p>The lesson: Our competitors had more checkboxes on their feature comparison charts, but we had better retention and higher conversion. They were building features; we were delivering outcomes.</p>
            <p><strong>Outputs vs. Outcomes</strong></p>
            <p>The fundamental confusion lies in mistaking what you build for the value it creates:</p>
            <p>Outputs: What you build (features, code, designs).</p>
            <p>Outcomes: The measurable changes in user behavior that drive business value.</p>
            <p><strong>Why features become toxic distractions</strong></p>
            <p>The "checkbox mentality": Building features just because competitors have them, leading to a bloated product that does many things poorly.</p>
            <p>The "solutioneering" trap: Teams love solving complex technical problems. Intellectual curiosity often drives the roadmap instead of actual user value.</p>
            <p>The "vanity metric" deception: It is easier to say "we shipped 15 features" than "we improved retention by 20%." Features create an illusion of progress.</p>
            <p>The forever cost: Every feature you add isn't just a one-time cost. It must be maintained, documented, and supported forever. Features are like children; conceiving them is the easy part.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Your product's value isn't measured in features; it's measured in the impact you deliver. Stop counting your features and start measuring your results. The most sophisticated feature in the world is worthless if it doesn't change user behavior in ways that matter.</p>
            <p>Build less, but build what matters. Your product (and your users) will thank you for the restraint.</p>
