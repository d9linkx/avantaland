            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>I hit my breaking point at 3 AM in a warehouse, covered in cardboard dust. Our fulfillment partner had failed, so for 72 hours, I became the fulfillment partner. I was so busy being a hero, packing boxes and answering support emails, that I neglected the real work of a CEO. Product development stalled and sales calls went unmade. I realized that trying to do everything yourself isn't dedication; it's a bottleneck. Your job isn't to be the most capable person in the company, but to build the most capable organization. Delegate or die.</p>

                    <span class="fix-text">1. Conduct a "time audit" with the 3D framework
For one week, track how you spend every working hour. Then categorize each task into tasks you: Delegate, Document, or Double down. Your goal is to systematically move tasks from "Double Down" to "Document" to "Delegate" over time.</span>

Every Friday, identify one task from your "Delegate" or "Document" categories to offload the following week. Monday: Document. Tuesday: Shadow. Wednesday: Watch. Thursday: Independent. Friday: Review.</span>

Before taking on any new task, ask: Is this something only I can do? Does this play to my unique strengths? Does this create disproportionate value? Is this the best use of my time?</span>

            <p>I hit my breaking point at 3 AM in a warehouse, covered in cardboard dust and despair. We were shipping our first major order (500 units) and our fulfillment partner had fallen through. So I became the fulfillment partner.</p>
            <p>For 72 hours straight, I was CEO, warehouse packer, customer service rep, and quality control inspector. My hands were raw from cutting tape. My back ached from lifting boxes. My mind was numb from answering support emails between packing sessions.</p>
            <p>In that moment, hunched over a shipping label printer that kept jamming, I had a crystal-clear realization: this is how businesses die. Not with a dramatic failure, but with the slow accumulation of tasks that shouldn't be the founder's job. I was so busy being a hero that I was failing as a leader.</p>
            <p>The turning point came when I looked at our metrics that week. Product development had stalled. Sales calls went unmade. Strategic partnerships languished. I'd saved so much on fulfillment costs but cost us at least $200 in missed opportunities. I was optimizing for the wrong things: for short-term savings instead of long-term growth, for personal capability instead of team capacity.</p>
            <p>The following week, I hired a part-time fulfillment helper for $15/hour. The freedom was intoxicating. I suddenly had 20 hours back to focus on what actually moved the needle. That $300 investment generated more value than any other decision I made that month.</p>
            <p><strong>Why founders struggle to let go</strong></p>
            <p>The founder's journey from "doer" to "delegator" is one of the most painful but necessary transitions in building a company. In the beginning, you have to do everything. But there comes a point where continuing to do everything becomes a form of selfishness.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Trying to do everything yourself isn't dedication. It's a limitation. Your first duty as a founder isn't to be the most capable individual contributor. It's to build the most capable organization.</p>
            <p>The boundaries you learn through painful experience become the guardrails that allow your company to scale beyond your personal capacity. Stop measuring your value by how busy you are, and start measuring it by what you enable others to accomplish. The most powerful thing you can do as a leader is to make yourself progressively less essential to daily operations.</p>
