            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>I hit my breaking point at 3 AM in a warehouse, covered in cardboard dust. Our fulfillment partner had failed, so for 72 hours, I became the fulfillment partner. I was so busy being a hero, packing boxes and answering support emails, that I neglected the real work of a CEO. Product development stalled and sales calls went unmade. I realized that trying to do everything yourself isn't dedication; it's a bottleneck. Your job isn't to be the most capable person in the company, but to build the most capable organization. Delegate or die.</p>

    <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>

            <span class="fix-text"><strong>1. Track and Sort Your Time:</strong> 
            For one week, write down everything you do. Then, put each task into one of three buckets: things you can <strong>Hand Off</strong> to someone else, things you need to <strong>Write Down</strong> as a guide, and things you should <strong>Focus On</strong> because only you can do them well.</span>

            <span class="fix-text"><strong>2. Use the "One Task a Week" Hand-Off:</strong> 
            Every Friday, pick one job to give away. Use the next week to move it: Monday (write the guide), Tuesday (they watch you do it), Wednesday (you watch them do it), Thursday (they do it alone), and Friday (you check their work).</span>

            Before you start any new job, ask yourself: "Am I the only person in the world who can do this?" if the answer is no, or if it doesn't use your best skills, look for a way to automate it or give it to someone else. Your time is too valuable for 'busy work.'</span>

            <p>I hit my breaking point at 3 AM in a warehouse, covered in cardboard dust and despair. We were shipping our first major order (500 units) and our fulfillment partner had fallen through. So I became the fulfillment partner.</p>
            <p>For 72 hours straight, I was CEO, warehouse packer, customer service rep, and quality control inspector. My hands were raw from cutting tape. My back ached from lifting boxes. My mind was numb from answering support emails between packing sessions.</p>
            <p>In that moment, hunched over a shipping label printer that kept jamming, I had a crystal-clear realization: this is how businesses die. Not with a dramatic failure, but with the slow accumulation of tasks that shouldn't be the founder's job. I was so busy being a hero that I was failing as a leader.</p>
            <p>The turning point came when I looked at our metrics that week. Product development had stalled. Sales calls went unmade. Strategic partnerships languished. I'd saved so much on fulfillment costs but cost us at least $200 in missed opportunities. I was optimizing for the wrong things: for short-term savings instead of long-term growth, for personal capability instead of team capacity.</p>
            <p>The following week, I hired a part-time fulfillment helper for $15/hour. The freedom was intoxicating. I suddenly had 20 hours back to focus on what actually moved the needle. That $300 investment generated more value than any other decision I made that month.</p>
            <p><strong>Why founders struggle to let go</strong></p>
            <p>The founder's journey from "doer" to "delegator" is one of the most painful but necessary transitions in building a company. In the beginning, you have to do everything. But there comes a point where continuing to do everything becomes a form of selfishness.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Trying to do everything yourself isn't dedication. It's a limitation. Your first duty as a founder isn't to be the most capable individual contributor. It's to build the most capable organization.</p>
            <p>The boundaries you learn through painful experience become the guardrails that allow your company to scale beyond your personal capacity. Stop measuring your value by how busy you are, and start measuring it by what you enable others to accomplish. The most powerful thing you can do as a leader is to make yourself progressively less essential to daily operations.</p>
