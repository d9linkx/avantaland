            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>A user survey nearly killed my startup. We asked 500 project managers if they'd use a new feature, and 87% said "definitely." We spent three months building it with confidence. On launch day, only three people used it. I learned a fatal lesson: surveys lie. They measure what people think they'll do, which is often a polite fiction. Prototypes, on the other hand, don't lie. They measure what people actually do when faced with a choice. Stop collecting opinions and start observing behavior. The truth is in the clicks, not the checkboxes.</p>

                    <span class="fix-text">1. Implement the "minimum viable prototype" standard
Before any significant build, create the simplest interactive representation: Clickable Figma/Adobe XD prototype, "Wizard of Oz" setup, or a Landing page with a "Request Access" button.</span>

When a user is testing your prototype, your primary job is to shut up and watch. Give the user a realistic task to complete. Record their screen and facial reactions. Take notes on hesitations.</span>

Replace hypothetical survey data with observable metrics: Instead of "80% say they'd use it", look for "70% of testers complete the core workflow without help."</span>

            <p>I once ran a user survey that nearly destroyed my startup. We were building a new feature for project managers and wanted to validate it before coding.</p>
            <p>The survey was elegant: multiple choice, Likert scales, Beautifully designed. Then we sent it to 500 project managers and the results were statistically significant: 87% of respondents said they'd "definitely or probably use" our proposed feature. We were ecstatic.</p>
            <p>So, as you would imagine, we spent the next three months building it. Launch day felt like a victory lap. We had the data to prove we were right.</p>
            <p>Then, silence. Out of those 217 people who said they'd use it, exactly 3 actually did. Not 3%; three human beings.</p>
            <p>The feature sat there, beautifully coded and utterly useless. The breakthrough came when I called a respondent who had said "definitely use" but never logged in. His response: "Oh, that survey. Yeah, I remember it. It sounded good in theory. But when I actually saw it... I guess I just don't have time to learn a new workflow right now."</p>
            <p>That's when I understood the fatal flaw: depending on surveys instead of prototypes. Surveys only measure what people think. Behavior shows what they actually do.</p>
            <p><strong>Why surveys lie to founders</strong></p>
            <p>Surveys lie for deeply rooted psychological and methodological reasons. They capture intentions, but intentions are not actions.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Surveys give you the answer you want to hear. Prototypes give you the truth you need to hear. So stop collecting opinions and start observing behavior.</p>
            <p>Your product's success depends not on what people say they'll do, but on what they actually do when faced with your solution. Build prototypes, not presentation PowerPoints. Watch clicks, not checkboxes. The truth is in hidden in plain sight in the user’s interaction with your prototype.</p>
