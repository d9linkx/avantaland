            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>A founder I knew assembled a board of mentors who were all cheerleaders. Every meeting was a love fest of encouragement. It felt great, but it was useless. The wake-up call came from a brutally honest investor who dismantled their entire business model in five minutes. The criticism was painful, but it saved the company. There are two types of mentors: comfort mentors who make you feel good, and challenge mentors who make you better. We naturally seek validation, but what we need is truth. Stop looking for cheerleaders. Find the mentors who aren't afraid to tell you your baby is ugly.</p>

    <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
    <div class="fix-list">
        <label class="fix-item">
            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>1. Build Your "Advice Team":</strong> 
            Don’t just look for one mentor. Find four specific types: 1. Someone in your industry (**Vertical**), 2. Someone who is an expert at a specific skill like sales or tech (**Functional**), 3. Someone one step ahead of you (**Stage**), and 4. Someone who helps you stay calm and focused (**Psychological**). Look for people who are strong where you are weak.</span>

            <span class="fix-text"><strong>2. Don't Waste Their Time:</strong> 
            Before you meet a mentor, send them a quick note with: the exact problem you’re stuck on, what you’ve already tried to do to fix it, and what you think the answer might be. This lets them give you real answers instead of just "nice" talk.</span>

            <span class="fix-text"><strong>3. Try to "Break" Your Ideas:</strong> 
            Before you make a big move, find someone to play "Devil's Advocate" and tell you why it might fail. Imagine it’s a year from now and the project has crashed—ask yourself, "What went wrong?" Finding the problems now is much cheaper than finding them later.</span>

            <p>Evans assembled what he called his "Board of Directors" in their first year. Three successful founders who believed in his vision. The problem was, they all believed in it too much. Every meeting was a love fest.</p>
            <p>"You're on the right track!" "Trust your instincts!" "This is going to be huge!" Their encouragement felt great, no doubt. But it wasn't helping them navigate the difficult decisions that were actually determining their fate.</p>
            <p>The turning point came during a pitch practice with a potential investor who had a reputation for being brutally honest. Within five minutes, he'd dismantled their entire business model. "Your customer acquisition math doesn't work," he said flatly. "Your pricing is naive. And you're solving a problem that doesn't seem painful enough for anyone to pay for."</p>
            <p>Evans left that meeting feeling physically sick. His first instinct was to dismiss the investor as "not getting it." But over the next 48 hours, the criticisms kept echoing in his mind. The investor was right about everything. So Evans accepted the reality in front of him and spent the next month completely rebuilding their strategy based on their challenges, and that saved the company.</p>
            <p>There are two categories of mentors: Comfort mentors (make you feel better) and Challenge mentors (show you a better path). The mentor selection process reveals a fundamental truth about founder psychology: we naturally gravitate toward validation when what we actually need is truth.</p>
            <p><strong>Why we choose the wrong mentors</strong></p>
            <p>The confirmation bias trap: We seek mentors who confirm our existing beliefs rather than challenge them. The fame fallacy: We pursue famous mentors for their brand value rather than their relevant experience or availability.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Comfortable mentors are like junk food. They taste good but provide little nutritional value. Challenging mentors are like vegetables. Sometimes hard to swallow, but essential for growth.</p>
            <p>The mentors who truly change your trajectory won't always make you feel good in the moment, but they'll help you build something that lasts. Choose truth over validation, challenges over comfort, and watch your decisions—and your company—transform as a result.</p>
