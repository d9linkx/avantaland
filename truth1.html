“I need to be sure it will work.”

You will never be sure. I can promise you that.

The market is a chaotic, living entity. The only way to find out what works (or doesn't) is to test your hypothesis in the market, not in a spreadsheet.</span>

“I can’t show this to anyone until the onboarding flow is flawless and we have a dark mode.”

This is the most seductive trap most founders fall into.

Perfectionism is just fear dressed in a well-tailored suit (fear of judgment, fear of criticism, etc.). A flawed, LIVE product is a thousand times more valuable (even to investors) than a perfect, imaginary, unhelpful one.</span>

                <span class="fix-text">1. The "today" tactic
I define this as the smallest possible action that makes the idea marginally more real than it was yesterday. It must be so small that it’s impossible to rationalize not doing it. Right now, choose one, and do it:

Buy that domain. Not tomorrow. Now. Spend the $12.
Create that public-facing social account. Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram. Handle: @YourIdea. Post one sentence: "Working on something new. What's your biggest pain point with [your problem area]?"
Write that "ugly" Landing Page Headline. One sentence that describes the core benefit. Don't build the page. Just write the sentence in a text file.

Done? Good.</span>

                <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                <span class="fix-text">2. The "this week" tactic
You are no longer allowed to say "I'm working on my startup." You are now working toward a specific, shippable artifact by a hard fixed real deadline. Tell one person (a founder friend, a brutally honest mentor) this sentence: "By this Friday, I will send you a link to [X]."

X = A Figma prototype with 3 clickable screens.
X = A Loom video of me explaining the problem and my solution to 5 potential users (and I'll show you their responses).
X = A one-page website describing the problem I solve, with a "Request Early Access" button.

That deadline is sacred. The quality is negotiable. The goal is to ship, not to perfect.</span>

                <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">

From this day forward, you are banning the phrase "I'm not ready to..." from your vocabulary. Replace it with: "What's the scrappiest version of this I can test?"

Need to validate demand? Don't build a full product. Run a $10 to $100 Google Ad to a landing page and see if anyone clicks.

Need to test a feature? Don't code it for two weeks. Use a mock-up and see if users even try to click on it.</span>

            <p>I checked the time on my locked smartphone screen. It read 7:38pm.</p><p>My laptop screen glowed back at me in the darkness of my dining table. On the screen was a blank Google document with thick black texts: Prawnbox’s Go-To-Market Strategy.</p><p>To my right was a thick notebook where I'd written all the brainstorming notes of our beloved peer-to-peer delivery platform. And on another open tab of my old MacBook Pro 2015 laptop was a spreadsheet with 152 lines of potential user demographics, and a head buzzing with a million reasons to wait.</p><p>“I just need to read one more Hacker News thread on scalable technology.”</p><p>“I should probably take an online marketing course first.”</p><p>“What if we finish building this and the tech stack becomes obsolete the next year?”</p><p>My cursor blinked back at me.</p><p>A tiny, relentless pulse of judgment.</p><p>I was a founder who had spent six months perfecting the blueprint for this app, terrified to ever break ground because I might find a rock in the sketch. I was so in love with the potential of my idea—its perfect, untarnished version in my mind—that the thought of exposing it to the judgemental, unforgiving real world felt like a form of suicide.</p><p>Hardly did I know that this delay wasn’t preparation. Instead, it was procrastination in a disguise so convincing I’d defend myself to the teeth. I was performing the theatre of work. Research, planning, brainstorming, holding meetings upon meetings…, all giving me the dopamine hit of progress without the terrifying risk of actual validation.</p><p>Yes, validation.</p><p>Overwhelmed with the workload both inside my brain and outside, I picked up my smartphone, an Itel P40+ (we listen, we don't judge, remember?), sat back in my work chair and sluggishly dragged my thumb to tap on the LinkedIn app.</p><p>I just scrolled through the posts. Chowdeck’s latest seeding round (yeah I’d seen that before), a content writer sharing her anger about hirers who post job openings for content writers but in the description, it’s for content strategists…</p><p>I just scrolled past that too.</p><p>Then another post startled me, jolting me up from my seat…</p><p>A two-person team, a startup with a ‘weird’ name, had just launched a beta version of my P2P delivery app idea! Their product did almost exactly what mine was supposed to do!</p><p>I stopped breathing for what seemed like minutes.</p><p>My stomach ached.</p><p>In panic, I clicked on the link in the post, and it took me to their website.</p><p>Their website wasn't as polished as my beautiful vision. It was clumsy, if you'd asked me (just consoling myself). Yet, they had the one thing I didn’t have: a link I could click, and a waiting list I could join on the spot.</p><p>They had started!</p><p>At that moment, my beautiful, perfect plan turned to ashes. It was a museum piece, while their scrappy, ugly beta was a living, breathing entity. They were already talking to users, getting feedback, and learning from their users. And me? I was in a silent work room in my minimalistic 2-bedroom flat, talking to myself.</p><p>Let’s cut the BS: you see that feeling in your gut? That tightness in your chest when you think about actually pressing ‘launch’? That lump that forms in your throat when you realize the heavy weight in front of you? It’s not a sign you’re not cut out for this. I call it the universal business founder sickness.</p><p>Readiness is a hallucination. You can never be truly ready.</p><p>Being ready to launch and sell is a horizon that gets even farther from you as you walk toward it. Why? Because you’re trying to solve a problem you don’t fully understand yet, for a market you can’t truly know until you’re in the arena with them.</p><p>You simply cannot learn to swim by reading books about hydrodynamics.</p><p>Can you become the world’s expert on theory by reading books about hydrodynamics? Yes, you can. But the moment you’re thrown into the water, you’ll flounder.</p><p>The water is always cold, it'll get up your nose.</p><p>It won't care about your diagrams.</p><p>Accept right now that you are unqualified, and start anyway. Experience is the only teacher that matters, and she is a brutal instructor. Get in the damn pool and splash around!</p><p>Will you swallow water? Yes, you will! Would look foolish to onlookers both experts and novices who only know how to mock you? Yes, you will! But you’ll learn faster in five minutes of panicked flailing than in five months of theoretical preparation.</p><p>The ‘Ready’ mindset is a trap meant to delay your progress. And it manifests itself in 3 familiar ways:</p><p>the credentialist</p><p>the fortune-teller, and</p><p>the perfectionist.</p><p>1. The credentialist
“I’m not a real CEO, I don’t have an MBA.” Tell that to Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.

Leadership isn’t conferred by a degree; it’s seized by taking responsibility.</p><p>2. The fortune-teller
“I need to be sure it will work.”

You will never be sure. I can promise you that.

The market is a chaotic, living entity. The only way to find out what works (or doesn't) is to test your hypothesis in the market, not in a spreadsheet.</p><p>3. The perfectionist
“I can’t show this to anyone until the onboarding flow is flawless and we have a dark mode.”

This is the most seductive trap most founders fall into.

Perfectionism is just fear dressed in a well-tailored suit (fear of judgment, fear of criticism, etc.). A flawed, LIVE product is a thousand times more valuable (even to investors) than a perfect, imaginary, unhelpful one.</p><p>Like Ben Kamens (Former VP of Engineering at Khan Academy) would say, “Shipping beats perfection. He believed, from experience, that every day a feature is "perfected" behind closed doors is a day a student doesn't get to learn from it.</p><p>He wrote: "It’s OK to be embarrassed about what your product doesn’t have. It’s not OK to wait until it’s perfect.”</p><p>Shipping helps you validate your idea.</p><p>In the venture capital world, this is called the Feedback Loop. Investors value the "Live" product because it starts the Measure and Learn phases.</p><p>So, the more dust you kick up moving forward, the clearer the journey gets.</p><p>An "imaginary" product, on the other hand, stays stuck in the Build phase forever, which is a high-risk "black hole" for investment capital.</p><p>So, always remember these liberating truths:</p><p>Starting is the best strategy.</p><p>Action is the catalyst that turns your fear into concrete problems you can actually solve.</p><p>A ‘no’ from a real user is better than a thousand ‘maybes’ in your business plan.</p><p>A bug in a live app is a real puzzle to fix, not a theoretical worry.</p><p>So, how do you break the cycle of wanting to get it perfected before you validate?</p><p>There are only three tactics you'll need for this to work:</p><p>The “today” tactic</p><p>The “this week” tactic, and</p><p>The “forever” tactic.</p><p>1. The "today" tactic
I define this as the smallest possible action that makes the idea marginally more real than it was yesterday. It must be so small that it’s impossible to rationalize not doing it. Right now, choose one, and do it:

Buy that domain. Not tomorrow. Now. Spend the $12.

Write that "ugly" Landing Page Headline. One sentence that describes the core benefit. Don't build the page. Just write the sentence in a text file.

Done? Good.</p><p>The goal is to create a "sunk cost" of emotion and a tiny piece of public accountability.</p><p>Read that again.</p><p>You've now invested. However trivially, you've begun. Now, you can expand.</p><p>2. The "this week" tactic
You are no longer allowed to say "I'm working on my startup." You are now working toward a specific, shippable artifact by a hard fixed real deadline. Tell one person (a founder friend, a brutally honest mentor) this sentence: "By this Friday, I will send you a link to [X]."

X = A Figma prototype with 3 clickable screens.
X = A Loom video of me explaining the problem and my solution to 5 potential users (and I'll show you their responses).

Need to test a feature? Don't code it for two weeks. Use a mock-up and see if users even try to click on it.</p><p>This should be your new rhythm:</p><p>Ship</p><p>Collect feedback</p><p>Cringe</p><p>Adjust</p><p>Ship again.</p><p>Because at this stage, your goal is to gather momentum. That's the most valuable asset you have now. In fact, it's more valuable than time, money, and (of course) more valuable than that perfect plan you have.</p>
