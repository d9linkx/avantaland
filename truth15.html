            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>I once built a visionary product for a problem that was six months away from existing. I was convinced privacy compliance would be a huge market. But when I talked to customers, they were worried about today's payroll and this week's sales, not next year's regulations. My "someday" solution couldn't compete with their "right now" emergencies. I was trying to sell vitamins to people who needed painkillers. The market doesn't reward foresight as much as it rewards immediate relief. Find the bleeding wound your customer is desperate to stop today. That's where your business lies.</p>

            <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
            <div class="fix-list">
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">1. Conduct the "current solution" autopsy
When interviewing potential customers, focus entirely on what they are doing right now to solve the problem: "What's the most expensive part of your current solution?" "What workarounds have you created?" If they aren't already trying to solve it, it’s not a "right now" pain.</span>

                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">2. Implement the "pain thermometer" test
Rate potential problems on a 1–10 scale across three dimensions: Frequency, Intensity, and Urgency. The formula: Multiply the scores. Anything below 200 is likely not worth a business; focus on pains that score 400+.</span>

                    <span class="fix-text">3. Create the "today test" for features
For every feature or product you consider building, ask: "If I shipped this tomorrow, would customers use it immediately?" "Does this replace something they are already paying for?"</span>

            <p>I once built a product for a problem that was six months away from existing. It was 2018, and I was convinced privacy regulations would create a massive market for "compliance automation."</p>
            <p>I spent months building a beautiful platform. I was early, I was visionary, and I was completely, utterly bankrupt within a year.</p>
            <p>The problem was simple: my potential customers didn't feel the pain yet. When I'd ask about data compliance, they'd say, "Yeah, that might be important later."</p>
            <p>They were worried about next quarter's revenue. They were worried about this week's payroll. They were worried about today's customer complaints.</p>
            <p>My brilliant solution was a "someday" problem competing against their "right now" emergencies.</p>
            <p>The turning point came during a demo when an e-commerce founder interrupted: "Forget that, can your system tell me why my checkout abandonment rate jumped 15% this week?"</p>
            <p>I saw the genuine panic in his eyes. That was a pain he felt in his gut, today. I pivoted to solving that instead. It wasn't visionary or sexy, but the founders didn't say "interesting". They asked "how do I get this right now?" and "how much does it cost?"</p>
            <p>The lesson: They were already feeling that pain, and they were actively searching for relief.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>The market rewards painkillers, not vitamins. Don't build something that might be important someday. Build something that solves a bleeding wound today.</p>
            <p>Find the thing that makes people say "Ouch!" and then be the bandage. Your customers' present pain will always fund your business more reliably than their future problems.</p>
