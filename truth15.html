            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>I once built a visionary product for a problem that was six months away from existing. I was convinced privacy compliance would be a huge market. But when I talked to customers, they were worried about today's payroll and this week's sales, not next year's regulations. My "someday" solution couldn't compete with their "right now" emergencies. I was trying to sell vitamins to people who needed painkillers. The market doesn't reward foresight as much as it rewards immediate relief. Find the bleeding wound your customer is desperate to stop today. That's where your business lies.</p>

    <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
    <div class="fix-list">
        <label class="fix-item">
            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>1. Look at their current "Workarounds":</strong> 
            Ask people how they are dealing with the problem today. Are they using 3 different tools to do one job? Are they paying a lot of money for a bad fix? If they aren't already trying to solve the problem themselves, it’s probably not a big enough deal for them to pay you.</span>

        <label class="fix-item">
            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>2. Use the "Pain Score" Math:</strong> 
            Give the problem a score from 1 to 10 on three things: How often does it happen? How much does it hurt? And how fast does it need to be fixed? Multiply those three numbers. If the total is low, walk away. If it’s high (above 400), you’ve found a winner.</span>

            <span class="fix-text"><strong>3. The "Use it Tomorrow" Rule:</strong> 
            For every idea you have, ask: "If I gave this to a customer tomorrow morning, would they use it right away?" and "Does this replace something they are already spending money on?" If the answer is no, the idea isn't ready.</span>

            <p>I once built a product for a problem that was six months away from existing. It was 2018, and I was convinced privacy regulations would create a massive market for "compliance automation."</p>
            <p>I spent months building a beautiful platform. I was early, I was visionary, and I was completely, utterly bankrupt within a year.</p>
            <p>The problem was simple: my potential customers didn't feel the pain yet. When I'd ask about data compliance, they'd say, "Yeah, that might be important later."</p>
            <p>They were worried about next quarter's revenue. They were worried about this week's payroll. They were worried about today's customer complaints.</p>
            <p>My brilliant solution was a "someday" problem competing against their "right now" emergencies.</p>
            <p>The turning point came during a demo when an e-commerce founder interrupted: "Forget that, can your system tell me why my checkout abandonment rate jumped 15% this week?"</p>
            <p>I saw the genuine panic in his eyes. That was a pain he felt in his gut, today. I pivoted to solving that instead. It wasn't visionary or sexy, but the founders didn't say "interesting". They asked "how do I get this right now?" and "how much does it cost?"</p>
            <p>The lesson: They were already feeling that pain, and they were actively searching for relief.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>The market rewards painkillers, not vitamins. Don't build something that might be important someday. Build something that solves a bleeding wound today.</p>
            <p>Find the thing that makes people say "Ouch!" and then be the bandage. Your customers' present pain will always fund your business more reliably than their future problems.</p>
