            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>A founder once proudly declared his market was "everyone with a smartphone." An investor laughed. I made the same mistake, building a tool "for teams" that resonated with no one. We only found traction when we niched down to indie game developers and solved their specific, painful problems. Choosing a niche feels like limiting your potential, but it's actually focusing your power. 100 people who love you are infinitely more valuable than 10,000 who "kinda like" you. Win a small, passionate beachhead first. From there, you can expand your empire.</p>

    <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
    <div class="fix-list">
        <label class="fix-item">
            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>1. Find a "Painful" Group:</strong> 
            Look for people who are currently struggling with messy, DIY solutions. Make sure they also have places where they talk to each other (like Facebook groups or local clubs). You want a group that is easy to find and desperate for a better way.</span>

            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>2. Spend 30 Days Listening:</strong> 
            Spend a month living in their world. Read their forums, talk to 15 people in that group, and learn the specific words they use to describe their problems. Don't sell yet—just learn their "language" so you sound like one of them.</span>

            <span class="fix-text"><strong>3. Test Before You Build:</strong> 
            Check if your idea is a winner by asking: Can I get 3 experts in this group to give me advice? Does my idea do something that big, general tools forget? Most importantly: Can I get 10 strangers to pay me before I even finish building it?</span>

            <p>I once watched a pitch meeting where a founder proudly declared his TAM was "everyone with a smartphone." Then an investor dryly asked him, "So your marketing strategy is 'hello, world'?"</p>
            <p>Everyone laughed. But it wasn’t funny.</p>
            <p>I made the same mistake with my second startup. We built a tool "for teams." Any teams. Startup, enterprise, remote, co-located. Our messaging was so broad it became meaningless. We spent $5,000 a month on ads and got zero qualified leads.</p>
            <p>The turning point came when we accidentally spoke to indie game developers. They were distributed, worked with massive asset files, and needed to coordinate artists and programmers. Their pain was visceral.</p>
            <p>We changed our homepage messaging to: "Finally, a tool that won't choke on your 4GB texture files." We didn't change the product, just the focus. We got 50 signups in one week.</p>
            <p>These users became our evangelists and guided our roadmap.</p>
            <p>The lesson: 100 people who love you are more valuable than 10,000 people who "kinda like" you. When you target everyone, you resonate with no one.</p>
            <p><strong>The "niche dominance" framework</strong></p>
            <p>Choosing a niche feels like limiting your potential, but it is actually focusing your resources.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>The sweet spot is High Pain + High Cohesion. These groups will adopt and spread your solution. Become the world’s leading expert on their problems for 30 days.</p>
