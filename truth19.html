            <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
            <div class="fix-list">
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">1. Implement the "three bucket" framework
Create three simple categories and stick to them: Runbooks (Step-by-step instructions), Decision logs (Capturing major decisions and rationale), and API contracts (Specifications for systems).</span>
                </label>
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">2. Create "documentation sprints"
Once per month, schedule a two-hour sprint where the entire team works exclusively on documentation: Hour 1 for updates, Hour 2 for peer review.</span>

                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">3. Build documentation into your "definition of done"
For every task or project, make these three requirements non-negotiable: Code changes (Updated README), Process changes (Updated runbook), and Key decisions (Updated decision log).</span>

            <p>The catastrophe happened at 2 AM on a Tuesday. Our payment system went down during a critical growth experiment. Revenue stopped flowing. Panic set in.</p>
            <p>The problem? The engineer who built the payment integration had left the company three months earlier. The only documentation was a single README file that said: "Uses Stripe API. See code."</p>
            <p>I watched our remaining engineers spend eight frantic hours reverse-engineering what should have taken twenty minutes to fix. They had to decipher variable names and guess at original design decisions.</p>
            <p>By the time they restored service, we'd lost: Thousands of dollars in abandoned transactions. A full week’s worth of engineering morale. The original development time (it took longer to fix than it did to build).</p>
            <p>That’s when I realized that documentation is compound interest. I learned this lesson again when a new customer success hire spent her first week asking the same five questions. The entire engineering team lost hours answering questions that should have been in a single document.</p>
            <p>Documentation feels like bureaucracy. The kind of thing big, slow companies do. But I've come to see it differently: documentation is compound interest for your time. Every hour you invest in it saves you ten hours later.</p>
            <p><strong>The brutal truth about business knowledge</strong></p>
            <p>Documentation isn't about polished manuals. It's about capturing knowledge that would otherwise be trapped in individual brains.</p>
            <p>Why businesses especially need documentation:</p>
            <p>The bus factor: How many people would need to get hit by a bus before your project becomes unrecoverable? In many businesses, this number is one.</p>
            <p>Onboarding acceleration: Every new hire takes 3x longer to become productive without it.</p>
            <p>Context preservation: Code tells you what; it rarely tells you why. Documentation prevents you from re-debating settled questions.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Documentation isn't paperwork. It’s time travel. It's your future self asking your present self for help.</p>
            <p>Every minute you spend documenting saves your future team hours of confusion and days of rework. In the marathon of building a company, documentation is what keeps you from going in circles. Document as you go, because the chaos never stops; it just changes form.</p>
