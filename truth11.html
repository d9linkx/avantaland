            <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
            <div class="fix-list">
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">1. Conduct the "pain point commonality" test
Interview 20 people who superficially resemble you. Do not pitch. Ask: "Walk me through how you handle [this task] now." The 70% rule: If fewer than 70% describe an identical pain point with similar intensity, you are building for an audience of one.</span>

                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">2. Implement the "alien user" protocol
Force yourself to watch someone use your prototype without instruction. Specifically, choose an "Alien User", someone opposite to you (e.g., if you’re technical, test with non-technical users). Pay attention to where they stumble.</span>

                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">3. Create the "founder detachment" ritual
Build systems that regularly challenge your ego: Weekly "Why" sessions to challenge assumptions, Founder "support shift" (2 hours/week), and The "kill your darlings" review every month.</span>

            <p>I built my first startup for the person I wished I was: a digital nomad working from beaches in Lagos, needing elegant productivity tools to manage my "empire." The product was beautiful: a minimalist task manager with Pomodoro timers and elegant analytics.</p>
            <p>I was my own perfect customer. I used it every day. I assumed everyone would.</p>
            <p>The problem was, I wasn't building for the person I actually was: a stressed founder working 80-hour weeks, juggling context switches, and needing to just not forget the damn payroll.</p>
            <p>My beautiful app was useless for that reality. When a real crisis hit, I'd abandon it and go back to a chaotic but functional combination of Google Docs, Calendar alerts, and Scribbled notes.</p>
            <p>The wake-up call came when I got my first 100 beta users. They didn't want beauty; they wanted Salesforce integrations and team task assignments. I found myself getting angry at them. "They don't get it," I'd mutter.</p>
            <p>No, I was missing the point. I’d built a cathedral to my own aesthetic preferences while my potential customers were asking for a functional warehouse.</p>
            <p>The lesson: I’d fallen in love with my own reflection in the product, and when the market showed me a different face, I couldn’t bear to look.</p>
            <p><strong>What makes you a "weirdo" in business terms?</strong></p>
            <p>You have "Founder-Product Fit" when your solution works for exactly one person: you. This happens when your needs are:</p>
            <p>Too niche: You're a power user in a sea of casual users.</p>
            <p>Too privileged: You have technical skills or resources your users lack.</p>
            <p>Too idiosyncratic: Your workflow is unique to your own strange habits.</p>
            <p>Not painful enough: It’s an annoyance you enjoy fixing, not a crisis others will pay for.</p>
            <p><strong>The three traps of building for yourself</strong></p>
            <p>The "everyone is like me" fallacy: Assuming your high tolerance for complexity and specific priorities are universal.</p>
            <p>The "solution blindness" trap: Becoming so enamored with your elegant solution that you stop questioning if the problem is worth solving for anyone else.</p>
            <p>The "feedback filter" problem: Dismissing negative feedback as a lack of "good taste" on the user's part.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Your own frustration is an excellent starting pistol, but a terrible finish line. Use your personal pain as a source of empathy and insight, not as a product roadmap.</p>
            <p>The market doesn’t care about your elegant solutions. It cares about its own messy problems. Build for the customer you have, not the customer you wish you were.</p>
