            <p>I learned the power of UX the hard way: through a million-dollar mistake. We'd built a B2B SaaS product with incredible backend technology. Our algorithms were brilliant, our feature set was comprehensive, and our infrastructure could handle massive scale. We had everything except users who stuck around.</p>

            <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
            <div class="fix-list">
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">1. Implement the "weekly user observation" ritual
Every week, watch one real user interact with your product. Not a demo; actual usage. You cannot help or guide them. The priority: Ask "What one change would have the biggest impact on reducing their frustration?"</span>
                </label>
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">2. Create the "UX debt" tracker
Just like technical debt, track UX debt in a public document. Prioritize using this formula: Impact × Frequency × Severity. Address the highest-scoring items in each sprint.</span>
                </label>
                <label class="fix-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
                    <span class="fix-text">3. Build the "usability testing" habit
Before shipping any feature, run a 5-minute usability test. The rule: If 2+ users struggle with the same element, you must redesign it before shipping. This catches 85% of usability problems.</span>

            <p>I learned the power of UX the hard way: through a million-dollar mistake.</p>
            <p>We'd built a B2B SaaS product with incredible backend technology. Our algorithms were brilliant, our feature set was comprehensive, and our infrastructure could handle massive scale. We had everything except users who stuck around.</p>
            <p>Our conversion rate was abysmal. Our support tickets were filled with the same basic questions. Our churn was bleeding us dry. I couldn't understand it. We were clearly the superior technical solution.</p>
            <p>Then we hired a UX researcher. She spent two weeks watching real users interact with our product. The results were humiliating: Users couldn't find the core feature we'd spent six months building. Our onboarding flow required 14 steps to reach the "aha moment." Our navigation was so confusing that people literally got lost and closed the tab.</p>
            <p>The killer insight came when she showed us a video of an ideal customer trying to complete a "simple" task. We watched him click around helplessly for three minutes, then give up and say, "This is too complicated. I'll just use spreadsheets."</p>
            <p>That moment cost us $1.2 million in development time and lost revenue. We had to rebuild our entire interface from scratch. The redesign took three weeks and increased our conversion rate by 300%.</p>
            <p>The truth: Users don't experience your code. They experience your interface. Your brilliant backend is worthless if users can't access it.</p>
            <p><strong>The ROI of usability</strong></p>
            <p>For every $1 invested in UX, you get $100 in return. That is a 9,900% ROI because it reduces support costs, increases conversion rates, improves retention, and decreases development waste.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Your product's usability is your first, most important feature. Every second you save users from confusion compounds into loyalty, retention, and growth. Stop building powerful products that nobody can use. Start building intuitive experiences that deliver value effortlessly. The best UX is invisible. It gets out of the way and lets your product's value shine through.</p>
