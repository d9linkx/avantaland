            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>My friends and family loved my first business idea. "This is amazing!" they all said. Encouraged, I spent six months and 90% of my savings building it. The launch was a disaster. Almost no one signed up. My most honest friend later admitted, "We didn't want to hurt your feelings by saying it wasn't necessary." Your friends' job is to support you emotionally; a customer's job is to solve their own problems. Don't confuse the two. The market tells the truth with its behavior, not with polite compliments. Stop talking to your friends.</p>

    <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
    <div class="fix-list">
        <label class="fix-item">
            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>1. Pass the "Stranger Test":</strong> 
            Find 50 people who do not know you and get their feedback. Friends and family will lie to be nice; strangers will tell you the truth. Go to the places where they hang out online or in person, ask them about their problems, and offer them something helpful for free in exchange for their time.</span>

            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>2. Use a "Commitment Score":</strong> 
            Don't trust someone who just says "that's a great idea." Use a points system to see if they mean it: Give them 1 point for asking a good question, 5 points if they offer to pay you right now, and 10 points if they introduce you to someone else who needs this. Talk is cheap; action is data.</span>

            <span class="fix-text"><strong>3. Set a "Reality Check" Number:</strong> 
            Your idea isn't "validated" until you hit a specific goal. Depending on what you're making, aim for: 10 strangers paying you money, 50 strangers using your tool every single week, or 5 people hiring you for your services. If you haven't hit these numbers, keep testing.</span>

            <p>The most dangerous feedback I ever received was glowing praise from everyone I knew. When I showed my first business (peer-to-peer delivery app) to friends and family, the responses were universally enthusiastic.</p>
            <p>"This is amazing!" "I'd totally use this!" “You're going to be huge!" My favorite was my aunt, who declared, "This is better than Facebook!"</p>
            <p>They were genuinely happy for me. Encouraged by this support, I spent six months and 90% of my savings building the full product. I launched with confidence, expecting the tidal wave of users. The wave never came.</p>
            <p>In fact, it was more like a slow leak. A few friends signed up out of obligation, used the app once, and never returned. The broader market was completely indifferent. After three months, we had 23 daily active users. 19 of them were people I knew personally.</p>
            <p>The moment of truth came when I asked my most brutally honest friend what went wrong. He finally admitted: "Look, we all thought it was a cool idea, but honestly? We already have group texts for making plans. We didn't want to hurt your feelings by saying it wasn't necessary."</p>
            <p>That lesson taught me something fundamental: Friendship and market validation are not the same. The people who care about you will instinctively protect your feelings, but the market will tell you the truth through their behavior (or lack thereof).</p>
            <p><strong>The psychology of the "friend filter"</strong></p>
            <p>The "friend filter" is one of the most common and dangerous validation traps for founders. Your friends and family are wired to support you emotionally, not evaluate your business/idea objectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Your friends' job is to support your dreams. Your customers' job is to solve their problems. Don't confuse the two.</p>
            <p>The market's indifference feels like rejection, but it's actually data. The truth might hurt your feelings, but it will save your business. Stop collecting compliments and start collecting hard truths. Your real customers are out there. Stop talking to your friends and start finding them.</p>
