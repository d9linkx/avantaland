            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>A founder I knew hired his first employee with only $18,000 in the bank and zero revenue. The pressure of the $8,000 monthly burn rate transformed a talented hire into a source of stress. The relationship soured, and the eventual firing was messy and expensive. Hiring before you have revenue is organizational suicide. You are betting your company's survival on someone else's productivity. Wait until you have a validated business model. Hire slowly and deliberately, focusing on cultural fit. And if you make a mistake, correct it fast. The cost of keeping the wrong person always exceeds the cost of letting them go.</p>

    <h3>Actionable Checklist</h3>
    <div class="fix-list">
        <label class="fix-item">
            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>1. Pass the "Do We Really Need This?" Test:</strong> 
            Before you hire anyone, prove it's necessary. Ask yourself: Will this person directly help us make more money? Do we have enough cash to pay them for at least 6 months? Can a freelancer or a software tool do this instead? Only hire if the answer is a clear "Yes," "Yes," and "No."</span>

            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>2. Hire for "Wins," Not Resumes:</strong> 
            Forget about where someone went to school. Instead, write down exactly what you want them to finish in their first month, second month, and third month. During the interview, give them a small task to prove they can actually deliver those specific results.</span>

            <input type="checkbox" class="fix-checkbox">
            <span class="fix-text"><strong>3. Use a "Vibe and Values" Filter:</strong> 
            Pick 3 things that matter most to how you work (like "moving fast" or "being honest"). Ask candidates to tell stories about how they handled tough situations in the past to see if they fit your style. Let other team members talk to them too—one bad attitude can ruin a whole team's momentum.</span>

            <p>Ferdinand made his first hire when his bank account had exactly $18,000 left. They hadn't earned a single dollar of revenue, but they had a "promising pipeline" and "strong investor interest." Big words, right?</p>
            <p>He hired Alex because he was talented, available, and shared their vision. What he didn't account for was the $8,000 monthly burn rate Alex represented, a time bomb that started ticking the moment he walked in the door.</p>
            <p>For three months, Ferdinand watched their runway evaporate while Alex built beautiful, technically impressive features that nobody was buying. The pressure transformed their relationship. Alex’s strategic oversight became micromanagement. His creative problem-solving became "scope creep."</p>
            <p>The end was messy, emotional, and expensive. When Ferdinand finally let him go, it was like a funeral. He felt he had failed as a leader, wasted precious capital, and damaged a talented person's career. The severance package and unused equity cost him another two months of runway.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, a fellow founder in another co-working space took a different approach. She didn't hire her first employee until she had six months of recurring revenue covering that person's salary. The interview process took four months. But when she finally hired, the new hire hit the ground running with little to no friction.</p>
            <p>The lesson: Don’t hire early just to fill up empty roles. You’re only risking your company's survival on someone else's productivity.</p>
            <p><strong>Why premature hiring is organizational suicide</strong></p>
            <p>Hiring before achieving revenue isn't just risky. It's often organizational suicide. You're simply making one of the most expensive, irreversible decisions your business will ever make.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Early hiring is like taking on a co-pilot when you're still figuring out how to fly the plane. Wait until you're at least airborne and know your destination.</p>
            <p>When you do hire, be more rigorous about evaluating fit than you are about evaluating skill. And when you realize you've made a mistake, fix it immediately—the cost of keeping the wrong person always exceeds the cost of letting them go. Your company's survival depends not just on who you hire, but when you hire and how quickly you correct your course.</p>
