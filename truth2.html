"To help you understand this, I'll tell you about two founders I shared a temporary co-working space with in February 2024.

On my left was a force of nature (let's call him John).

John could pitch his vision for a decentralized learning platform with the fire of a revolutionary leader. He’d use phrases like “democratizing education” and “tearing down the ivory towers.” You’d leave a conversation with him feeling inspired, almost evangelical.

He had also a designer on retainer to make his mockups look like Apple products.

On my right hand side was a quiet, almost painfully pragmatic lady in her early 30s (let's call her Bukola).

Her idea—a tool for managing restaurant inventory—didn’t look sexy. She described it as something that helped stressed out chefs reduce food waste by 15% and save a few hours a week. No “majestic” visions, right?

But Bukola had spent the last five years as a salesperson for a POS system.

She knew every restaurant owner in the city. She knew their headaches, their budgets, and how to talk to them. She also taught herself enough basic coding to hack together a functional prototype in Bubble.

By the first month, guess who was processing real payments from real customers within four months? It wasn't Anthony.

Anthony's passion was a castle in the air. It was beautiful, impressive, and completely disconnected from the ground.

When investors asked for traction, he had none.

When he tried to hire a developer, he couldn’t articulate the technical requirements because he didn’t speak the language.

His passion soon became a liability; it blinded him to the gritty work of building a business.

Little did he know that he was just a performer on a good stage with no play.

Bukky (as we fondly called her), on the other hand, was a builder at heart. Her skills were her tools. Her execution was her daily watering. It was slow, it was muddy, and it was spectacularly unglamorous. But her business grew.

This is why I don't always recommend passion as your primary roadmap to success.

You have to be very practical.

Passion is just the keynote speaker at your startup’s launch event. Skills and execution are the janitorial staff that shows up every night to clean the toilets and take out the trash. Without the latter, the event is a one-off spectacle followed by a lingering, unpleasant smell.

There's this popular belief that a lone visionary, armed with nothing but belief, can change the world. That's a dangerous lie told by pop culture and tech media. It's the “passion hypothesis” on steroids, and it’s responsible for more product failures than any bad market or flawed idea.

Passion is an emotional state.

It’s volatile and unreliable.

It abandons you at 3 AM when you’re staring at a broken database and your bank balance is ticking toward zero.

Skills, however, are cold, hard currency.

They don’t care how you feel.

Knowing how to debug that database, or how to negotiate an extension with your landlord, or how to write a sales email that gets a 10% reply rate—these are tangible assets that pay the bills regardless of your mood.

So, dear founder, it's time to deconstruct the fantasy. Here are some sub truths you must embrace:

1. Passion is about “you”; execution isn't

Passion is intrinsically selfish. It’s about your love for the idea, your vision, and your dream.

Execution is all about what your customer needs, what they’ll pay for, and how you can deliver it reliably. The market rewards service, not self-indulgence.

2. Passion is like a megaphone; skill is like a scalpel

Passion makes you talk louder. Skill allows you to listen and get to the heart of the problem. You can be passionately wrong. It’s harder to be skillfully wrong.

A skilled copywriter can pivot a failing ad campaign with a few tested headlines. A passionate founder will just double the ad spend on the same failing ads, believing harder in the message.

3. Passion is the sizzle; skill is the steak

Your customers might only buy once for the story you told them. Them coming back depends on the quality of your product. And, this can only be delivered through skilled execution.

4. Passion is mental self-pleasure

This is the most dangerous byproduct of the passion trap.

That endless cycle of brainstorming, ideating, and vision-crafting that gives you the illusion of productivity because you're scared of external judgment.

It’s easier to design a new logo than it is to make your first 100 cold calls.

Passion will always steer you toward the easier, more ego-satisfying task. Execution demands you do the hard, annoying work.

Want to surgically remove this dependency on passion and rebuild your identity as an executor? Then you need a system. And it starts with your mindset.

You have to stop seeing yourself as a passionate founder, and start seeing yourself as an intern of all trades.

Here's how to do this.

1. Conduct a T-shaped skill audit (this weekend)

Pick up a white cardboard paper and with a pencil, draw a large ""T"" on it.

On the vertical stem of the T, list your one or two deep skills (the things you’re genuinely good in). E.g., software architecture, clinical research, supply chain logistics, UI/UX design, copywriting, etc). This represents your general foundation; your credibility check.

Now, on the horizontal bar, list the shallow-but-necessary skills you are currently failing at. Be brutally specific here. For example , instead of writing “marketing”, write:

Writing clean persuasive Google Ad copy

Setting up and interpreting a Facebook Pixel

Designing a lead magnet that actually converts

Conducting a user interview that uncovers real pain points

Your immediate goal is to elevate every skill on the horizontal bar from ""liability"" to “clear"" and ""functional."" You don't need to be the world's best copywriter; you just need to be better than 80% of other technical founders.

Then, move on to the next step.

2. Implement the ""one-hour apprenticeship"" daily ritual

For the next 90 days, dedicate one uninterrupted hour everyday to deliberate practice on one of your ""shallow"" skills. This is not the time for passive learning. This is an active creation.

If it's sales: write and refine a 150-word cold email template, then sending it to 10 people.

If it's copywriting: rewrite the headline and sub-headline on your landing page 20 different ways and showing them to a paid focus group on UsabilityHub, Discord, LinkedIn, and anywhere else you can find people like you.

If it's finance: build a simple, rolling 13-week cash flow forecast in Excel.

Do this for one uninterrupted hour, every single day, for 90 days.

This ritual systematically converts your passion into a portfolio of usable, bill-paying skills.

3. Create a ""Bias for Action"" scorecard

At the end of each week, you will grade yourself on a simple 1-10 scale for one metric: The Ratio of Decisions Executed to Decisions Discussed.

If you spent 3 hours in a meeting debating two feature approaches, that's just a discussion.

But if you spent the next day building a bare-bones prototype of each and showing them to 5 users, that, my friend, is execution.

A week full of discussions with no execution is a score of 1.

A week where for every discussion, you produced a tangible, testable outcome, is a score of 10.

This scorecard forces you to confront your own tendency toward passion-theatre and replaces it with a relentless focus on tangible outputs.

In conclusion

Passion is good, don’t get me wrong. Because that's the spark you'll need. But, more important than that spark are the skills you MUST acquire on your journey.

Skills are the kindling your passion needs so it doesn't quench. Without it, your spark is merely a brief, pretty flash in the dark, followed by nothing but cold, empty air."
